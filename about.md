  <h1>About SATM Engineering</h1>
  <p>
    SATM Engineering is a multidisciplinary team of builders, researchers, and operators. We
    design resilient systems that connect people, infrastructure, and emerging technology with
    measurable impact.

  <p>
    This blog is our public lab notebook. Expect to find deep dives into how we architect
    solutions, honest retrospectives on what worked (and what did not), and practical advice you
    can apply to your own engineering practice.
