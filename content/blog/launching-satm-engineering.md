We're excited to launch SATM Engineering, a boutique consultancy focused on helping teams unlock reliable delivery. After years building platforms and operations at product companies, we saw a gap: organizations needed not just tools, but experienced engineers who can co-create practices and enablement.

Our engagements emphasize:

1. **Clarity of outcomes** – We partner with leadership to define business goals and measurable indicators of success.
2. **Engineering excellence** – We design pragmatic architectures, automation, and observability tailored to the current stage of your organization.
3. **Enablement** – We leave behind durable systems, documentation, and mentoring so your teams can continue to evolve confidently.
